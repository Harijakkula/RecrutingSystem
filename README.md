**Introduction**

The job application and hiring system is designed to streamline the recruitment process for a company. It includes classes representing different components of the hiring process, such as candidates, positions, reviewers, interviewers, and hiring managers. Additionally, the system generates reports for each stage of the process.

**How to Use**

Clone the repository or copy the Java code into your preferred Java IDE.

The main class is Main.java, which contains the main method and serves as the entry point for the application.

In the main method, you can define positions using the Position class and candidates using the Candidate class. Reviewers, interviewers, and hiring managers are represented as arrays in the main method.

Run the Main class to start the job application and hiring process.

**Classes Overview**

Person.java
Person is a base class representing a person with common attributes such as name, phone number, and email ID.
Position.java
Position represents different job positions and their statuses (open or closed). It allows defining positions and their details.
Candidate.java
Candidate represents candidates applying for job positions. It provides methods for candidates to apply for a position and stores their application details.
Reviewer.java
Reviewer represents individuals who review candidates for a particular position. It allows reviewers to assess candidates' qualifications for a specific job.
Interviewer.java
Interviewer represents individuals who interview candidates for a particular position. It allows interviewers to evaluate candidates during the interview process.
HiringManager.java
HiringManager represents hiring managers responsible for making final hiring decisions. It allows hiring managers to hire successful candidates for open positions.
Report.java and its subclasses
Report is an abstract class representing a report generated during the hiring process.
PdfReport and HtmlReport are subclasses of Report, responsible for generating reports in PDF and HTML formats, respectively.
Enums
PositionStatus and CandidateStatus are enums defining different statuses for positions and candidates, respectively.

**Usage**

Define positions and candidates in the main method of the Main class.

Reviewers, interviewers, and hiring managers are represented as arrays in the main method. Add individuals to these arrays to assign them specific roles.

Run the Main class to initiate the job application and hiring process.

The program will automatically apply candidates for open positions, review them, interview them, and make hiring decisions based on the review and interview outcomes.

The hiring decisions and review/interview statuses will be printed during the process.

**Customization**

You can customize the program to meet specific requirements. Here are some possible modifications:

Add more attributes to the Person class or create subclasses for different types of people (e.g., Applicant, Employee, etc.).

Extend the Position class to include additional information about positions, such as job descriptions, qualifications, or salary ranges.

Implement different review and interview processes based on specific criteria or use external data sources for evaluation.

Customize the report generation process to include additional details or output formats.

Improve error handling and add user input options for a more interactive experience.
